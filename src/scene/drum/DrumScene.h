 * @brief A class that represents a scene for playing drums.
 * @details This class is a subclass of Scene and adds functionality for playing
 * drums. It includes a menu item for selecting the octave, as most MIDI drum
 * kits start on a C note. This scene is similar to the NoteScene, the main
 * difference being that the note is selected by choosing an octave.
